The Okta integration allows you to automate user management within your Semaphore organization, as well as to use Okta apps for Single Sign On.

## Overview

Semaphore implements SCIM protocol for integration with ID providers like Okta, and SAML for user management for provisioning and deprovisioning users.

SAML and SCIM are well-established protocols and have become de facto standards for user management and identity management, especially in large enterprise corporations. For an in-depth explanation on how they work, see the [Okta's Undestanding SAML documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/) and [Okta SCIM 2.0 protocol](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/)

:::tip

If you would like to use this feature with a different SCIM/SAML ID provider, please contact the [Semaphore support team](https://semaphoreci.com/contact).
